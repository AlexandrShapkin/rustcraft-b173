# Beta 1.7.3 reference policy

The project intentionally maintains a research perimeter under `reference/`. Reference material is
used to understand familiar behavior, formats, constants and visual conventions; it does not define
production architecture.

Read `reference/SOURCES.md` for the source map and use `just refs-status` to see what is locally
available.

## Source classes

Historical/reconstructed material is best for questions such as "what did Beta 1.7.3 actually do?".
Independent reimplementations are useful for cross-checking interpretation and seeing alternative
implementations. Technical wikis/mappings are navigation aids. Vanilla assets are a visual baseline.
Libre/open assets are preferred for redistributable tests/examples.

The product contract still wins: this project is not pixel-identical, algorithmically identical or
bug-for-bug compatible. It may deliberately replace historical behavior or presentation with
clearer mechanics and scalable implementations while retaining semantic expectations and a
recognizable Beta-like identity.

## Reference-first feature gate

Observable gameplay and UI work must begin with a bounded study of the locked references. Invoke
`.agents/skills/reference-study/SKILL.md`, run `just refs-status`, and write a concise note under
`reference/notes/features/` before changing production code. The note records sources, revisions,
observable behavior, input and presentation semantics, edge cases, intentional deviations and an
acceptance criterion set. Purely internal storage, CI, transport, serialization, logging and profiler
changes are exempt unless they alter visible behavior.

Each new feature note records:

- reference behavior;
- semantic invariants;
- implementation-independent expectations;
- details safe to change;
- optimization opportunities;
- chosen RustCraft behavior;
- intentional deviations;
- acceptance criteria.

Reference research informs a decision; it does not automatically select exact reproduction.
Historical M3 exact-fidelity notes remain valid evidence for that completed repair campaign, but
their local acceptance target is not the default policy for future work.

## Rules

Use reference material narrowly to answer concrete questions such as movement behavior, block
interactions, crafting rules, protocol details, region/NBT conventions or texture-atlas behavior.
Then write original idiomatic Rust for this architecture.

Do not:

- mechanically translate Java/C++/Rust reference implementations class/module by class/module;
- copy substantial source fragments into production code;
- inherit another project's architecture merely because it already implements Beta behavior;
- make the Java class hierarchy/API structure the engine architecture;
- copy AGPL reference implementation code into this project's source;
- commit local proprietary game assets/reference source by default;
- package Mojang-owned vanilla assets into bootstrap archives/releases by default;
- preserve an inefficient historical implementation solely because it is historically exact.

When a durable finding matters, record the question, sources consulted, conclusion and deliberate
project divergence (if any) under `reference/notes/`.

## Local paths

Optional decompiled/reference source:

`reference/minecraft-beta-1.7.3-src/`

Optional vanilla/default texture pack:

`reference/assets/vanilla-b1.7.3/`

or:

`reference/assets/vanilla-b1.7.3.zip`

Public reference clones live under `reference/external/` and are managed by the `just refs-*`
recipes. They are git-ignored rather than vendored.
