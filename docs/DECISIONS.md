# Architecture decisions

Keep entries short. Add a new entry when a choice changes a durable contract.

## D-001 — Familiar behavior, not exact Beta compatibility

Status: accepted.

Beta 1.7.3 is the gameplay/visual reference. Internal algorithms, timing implementation, protocol,
storage and historical bugs are not compatibility requirements.

## D-002 — Platform plus first-party gameplay modules

Status: accepted.

Generic engine/runtime code remains independent of Beta-specific gameplay. The default game is
assembled from native first-party gameplay modules.

## D-003 — Semantic controller boundary

Status: accepted.

Humans, network clients, bots, replays and tests feed semantic intent into the same simulation
boundary. Simulation code does not read device events directly.

## D-004 — Bots are first-class

Status: accepted.

The platform owns an Agent/Bot API. Bots should not need renderer emulation or reverse-engineered
client automation.

## D-005 — Server-defined content profiles

Status: accepted.

Clients and bots automatically resolve required server content. Packages have targets so headless
bots do not fetch graphical/audio-only resources.

## D-006 — Native first-party, sandboxed third-party executable modules

Status: accepted.

First-party gameplay runs as native Rust. Untrusted downloadable executable content is sandboxed;
servers must never cause automatic loading of arbitrary native libraries.

## D-007 — `just` is the canonical developer command surface

Status: accepted.

Cargo remains the build system. `just` provides stable human/agent recipes for checks, smoke runs,
diagnostics and optional tooling.

## D-008 — Advanced optimization is measurement-driven

Status: accepted.

SIMD, io_uring, custom allocators, NUMA, lock-free structures, special databases and similar
techniques require a representative workload and measurement before adoption.

## D-009 — M0 simulation uses a generic voxel world and semantic action path

Status: accepted.

The first headless slice keeps chunk storage, AABB collision and fixed-step movement in generic
engine/runtime code. First-party blocks and flat generation register through gameplay modules;
break/place requests arrive as semantic controller intent and are also exposed through the Bot API.

## D-010 — wgpu and winit are isolated to the graphical path

Status: accepted.

The render crate owns wgpu device/surface/pipeline resources and CPU mesh extraction. The client
owns the winit event loop and translates platform input into semantic intent; runtime and server
remain free of graphics dependencies.

## D-011 — Render presentation copies only dirty world sections

Status: accepted.

The client keeps a RenderWorld presentation cache. Initial chunks are extracted once, then runtime
dirty notifications update changed X/Z sections and their boundary neighbors. CPU face-culling
meshes and GPU buffers are chunk-level resources; greedy meshing is deferred.

## D-012 — Local development resources resolve through content paths

Status: accepted.

The client uses the content crate's local resolver for the ignored/development terrain atlas path.
The renderer receives a resolved path and does not encode Minecraft asset locations in engine APIs.

## D-013 — World coordinates use X/Z horizontal and Y up

Status: accepted.

World, collision, section origins, mesh vertices and first-person camera math use X and Z for
horizontal axes and positive Y for vertical height. The view is right-handed with camera forward
mapped to -Z. CPU matrix helpers construct and multiply rows; `P * V * I` is converted once to
four f32 columns for WGSL `matrix * vector`. A transpose alone cannot repair mixed row/column
constructors. See `docs/RENDER_DIAGNOSTICS.md` for the verified convention and staged evidence.

## D-014 — Material tint is separate from lighting

Status: accepted.

First-party texture resolution supplies linear RGB tint with a white default. The renderer applies
it separately from face brightness. The flat-world grass top uses a fixed authored tint for its
grayscale atlas tile; biome coloration remains outside M1. Diagnostic checker/stone scenes stay
white-tinted and unlit.

## D-015 — M2 content, state and inventory

Status: implemented.

Blocks and items use separate typed u32 handles and semantic names in registries. A stored
BlockState holds a block handle and reserved variant bits (currently all authored states use zero).
Definitions express full-cube/empty collision, material, face resources, breakability, optional
item/block correspondence, stack limits, capabilities, emission and independent light opacity.
First-party atlas coordinates stay in gameplay-blocks; renderer APIs receive resolved tiles/tints.

Simulation owns a fixed 36-slot inventory (Option<ItemStack>, u16 counts), including the selected
nine-slot hotbar index. Selection, wheel changes and use/break arrive through AgentIntent. Placement
validates the selected item, destination and solid-block/player intersection before consuming one
item. Explicit controller placement also validates the semantic ray's adjacent cell and block hint;
explicit breaking must match the ray target. Direct simulation action methods remain useful to
trusted headless scenarios; controllers do not receive mutable World access. Development stacks
are seeded by semantic names at composition time and can be replaced without changing inventory.

## D-016 — M2 lighting and mesh invalidation

Status: implemented.

World owns packed four-bit sky/block channels in contiguous section arrays. Runtime Lighting owns
contiguous direct-sky seeds per loaded section and column bounds. Initialization traverses loaded
columns plus a one-section vertical light margin. An edit recomputes direct seeds only in its X/Z
column, then runs a deduplicated FIFO relaxation queue. Opening/closing sky and adding/removing
emitters converge using attenuation of at least one for propagated edges; vertical direct sky
retains 15 through clear air. Column extension initializes only that newly expanded column.

Every changed voxel/light value marks its section and any face-adjacent sections needed for
neighbor samples. Presentation copies dirty sections and their light halos, and existing GPU mesh
entries are replaced. Empty geometry is not drawn. M2 uses max(sky, block), a small brightness
floor and directional face shading; smooth lighting/AO is deferred. The temporary full-cube lamp
proves emission and removal. No renderer writes authoritative light or block state.

Opaque, Cutout, Translucent and Invisible are content classifications. Opaque neighbors hide
faces; identical nonopaque neighbors suppress shared faces; different nonopaque materials retain
interfaces. M2's atlas glass uses binary alpha and the cutout shader path. Fractional alpha and
sorted translucent rendering remain explicitly deferred, as do more sophisticated leaf interiors.

## D-017 — HUD and diagnostics are presentation

Status: implemented.

The purpose-built HUD consumes a read-only snapshot of slots, selection and the simulation's
RayHit voxel. Project-authored 5x7 glyphs, nearest atlas icons and integer scale produce crisp UI.
F3 is client state, never AgentIntent. DebugMetricsSnapshot periodically gathers simulation,
renderer, mesh, process and optional hardware counters; drawing code reads no world or OS data.
Debug text geometry/uploads are cached until text or dimensions change. Crosshair, slot and outline
geometry use bounded reusable buffers. Outline edges are currently projected screen-space lines.

## D-018 — Measurement definitions and scheduler policy

Status: implemented.

Headless runtime metrics use fixed 240-sample histories, without per-sample allocation. Rolling FPS
is 1 / mean frame interval. 1% low is 1 / mean of the slowest ceil(N/100) intervals, unavailable
before 100 valid samples. Tick and mesh durations use bounded histories. Actual TPS and rebuilds/s
are completed counts divided by elapsed monotonic wall time, refreshed after at least one second;
they are not configured-rate constants. Displayed target TPS is 20. Simulation timings exclude
presentation extraction/meshing; mesh timings include generation/upload preparation.

FixedStepClock retains fractional elapsed time, runs at most five 50 ms ticks per event-loop turn,
and deliberately drops whole excess ticks after a longer stall. It never increases tick dt or
changes the subsequent rate. The catch-up flag identifies turns needing multiple ticks. This
bounds the work after suspend/drag/long frames instead of accumulating an unbounded backlog.

Linux process sampling runs every 500 ms using /proc/self/status (RSS, threads), /proc/self/stat
(process user+system ticks) and /proc/stat (aggregate ticks and logical CPU count). CPU 100% means
one logical core; RSS is the kernel's inexpensive approximate resident figure. No new dependency
is needed. Other OSes or unreadable samples return None/N/A. See the kernel's
[/proc documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/proc.html).

GPU frame duration uses optional wgpu TIMESTAMP_QUERY from world-pass beginning to HUD-pass end,
asynchronous readback and queue timestamp period. It excludes presentation wait and capture copy.
Hardware utilization/VRAM have a separate optional client provider. Exactly one DRM device must
match adapter PCI vendor/device IDs; otherwise N/A. The Linux provider reads supported
[amdgpu sysfs counters](https://docs.kernel.org/gpu/amdgpu/thermal.html) at 500 ms intervals.
These are whole-device figures, not process VRAM or utilization inferred from frame duration.
No NVML/vendor dependency is mandatory. Unsupported timestamp/hardware metrics remain N/A.

## D-019 — M3 survival state and telemetry labels

Status: implemented.

`GameMode` is authoritative simulation state. Development mode seeds the temporary loadout;
Survival starts empty and routes block breaking through drops, item entities, pickup and inventory.
Item entities are compact value records with semantic `ItemStack`, velocity, age and pickup delay;
the runtime performs bounded merge/pickup passes and exposes semantic observations. ItemStack damage
is mutable per stack for tools, while the item definition supplies category, tier, speed and maximum
durability. Recipes are semantic shaped/shapeless records in a registry; the small 2x2 player grid
supports the first progression recipes. Rendering receives item position snapshots only.

F3 labels adapter telemetry as `Device GPU busy` and `Device VRAM`; process CPU/RSS remain distinct.
Present mode is shown explicitly with `(VSYNC)` for FIFO. These values are whole-device where the
platform provider says so and remain N/A without a matching provider.

## D-020 — M3.1 interaction presentation

Status: implemented.

Continuous mining uses the existing semantic `AgentIntent.attack` field as a held state. The
client clears it on release, focus loss and inventory mode; Survival mining resets on release or
target change and advances only on fixed simulation ticks. Dropped items are extracted into a
world-space sprite buffer and rendered with depth testing, while the HUD remains screen-space.
Inventory is a read-only snapshot with semantic slot-operation calls. Crack feedback is a
transient world-space overlay generated from the target block and mining stage; it never rebuilds
the persistent chunk mesh.

## D-021 — Beta resource-backed M3.2 presentation

Status: implemented.

The player inventory uses the semantic `gui/inventory.png` resource and the researched 176×166
layout. Block items opt into a shared 3D/isometric presentation for GUI, hotbar, cursor and world
drop paths; sprite items retain a 2D path. Destroy stages resolve to terrain atlas tiles 240–249.
Reference behavior is recorded before implementation in the M3.2 feature note, while the content
profile remains responsible for resource and presentation selection.

## D-022 — M3.8 canonical presentation geometry and offscreen inspection

One immutable full-cube face definition owns position perimeter, UV correspondence, normals
and triangle indices. World, GUI and dropped-item transforms consume that geometry. The
atlas uses top-left image coordinates; only `tile_uv` performs atlas addressing. GUI items
use the source-derived column-vector transform, a depth-cleared pass and back-face culling;
GUI projection is independent of the gameplay camera. Resolved `BlockModel` carries semantic
face textures/tints and model rotation for both production presentation and inspection.

`offscreen::Scene` renders clip-space vertices to its own readable color/depth attachments.
It never copies a swapchain image or requires a visible window. The client CLI is the
first-party content adapter; renderer code contains no Beta block IDs or local asset paths.
Generated charts work without assets. Real-texture cases use the existing local resource
resolver. Outputs are deterministic local PNGs, suitable for future toleranced image diffs;
no unaccepted golden image or proprietary image is checked into source control.

## D-023 — compact semantic orientation foundation

Retain the existing `BlockState { block: BlockId, variant: u16 }` (8 bytes including padding),
with typed `Facing`, `Axis` and `HorizontalRotation` accessors. Facing uses bits 0..2, axis
3..4, horizontal rotation 5..6; other bits are reserved/preserved. Zero means North (-Z),
Y axis, R0. Typed constructors produce equal values for equal settings; no state-ID registry,
per-voxel string/map, allocation or opaque Beta metadata interpretation is introduced.

A block definition declares `orientation_property` (None/Facing/Axis/HorizontalRotation)
and a `base_model_rotation`. Proper signed orthogonal matrices rotate around the cube center.
Composition is base * state (column vectors: state first). First-party blocks currently keep
None/identity, so placement/gameplay behavior does not change. State survives world storage
and presentation extraction. Meshing rotates the complete geometry and its neighbor-facing
normal while keeping UVs attached; `state_texture` is a separate resolver hook for content
that selects a different material by state. Metadata import mappings and directional-block
gameplay are deferred. No furnace/door/stair mechanics were added.

## D-024 — engine mechanism and game policy boundary

The dependency direction is platform → engine → `game-api` → game package → optional packages.
Engine crates contain reusable voxel/runtime mechanisms and never depend on `minecraft-b173`.
Minecraft Beta behavior and content are policy implemented by the first-party game package using
the same public registration mechanisms available to another native game or native mod.

The initial `game-api` is intentionally small: validated namespaced IDs, generic voxel
definitions, package registration, native fixed/update schedules, a controlled block-mutation
command buffer and profile composition. Static function systems and compact/indexed storage avoid
hot-path indirection. New capabilities and commands require a concrete consumer.

## D-025 — incremental Minecraft package migration

`minecraft-b173` is the composition boundary for the existing first-party block and flat-world
modules. Client and server depend on it rather than importing those modules directly, and validate
its public Game API registration at startup. The M0-M3 `runtime` and `mod-api` remain transitional:
they mix reusable mechanisms with Minecraft inventory, mining, drops and crafting policy. Those
areas migrate when next extended, preserving accepted behavior rather than forcing a rewrite.

## D-026 — GameProfile and non-Minecraft architecture test

`GameProfile` composes namespaced package, resource and system identities with the existing content
manifest. It is composition metadata, not a general package manager. `sandbox-test` is a tiny
non-Minecraft game that registers four generated/debug blocks, consumes generic controller intent,
runs native scheduled systems, applies a queued world command and renders through the shared
offscreen renderer. Its Just recipe rejects dependencies on Minecraft, legacy gameplay crates and
the mixed runtime, making it a permanent dependency-direction integration test.

Compact `BlockState { BlockId, variant }` remains the engine storage strategy. Beta metadata
mapping, Minecraft properties and gameplay meaning belong in the Minecraft package.

## D-027 — semantics and scalability outrank exact Beta fidelity

Status: accepted; current project direction.

Beta 1.7.3 remains the first-party gameplay/content reference, visual style baseline and source of
recognizable interaction contracts. It is not a pixel-identical, behavior-identical or
algorithmically identical compatibility target. Prior exact-fidelity M3 notes remain historical
evidence for a completed repair campaign; they do not set the default policy for future systems.

Engineering priority is: clear predictable semantics; performance and frame-time stability;
large-world/content/mod scalability; Game API cleanliness; overall Beta-like identity; exact
fidelity. A measured or well-justified optimization may accept moderate visual differences while
preserving semantic readability. Substantial choices compare runtime/frame-time, memory,
scalability and extensibility benefit with visual/semantic cost, complexity and maintenance.
