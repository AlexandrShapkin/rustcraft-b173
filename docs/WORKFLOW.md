# Development workflow

Work in coherent vertical batches. The owner wants low interaction overhead: make routine technical
decisions autonomously, implement them, validate them and report results.

For a player-observable Beta-like feature, use the reference-first gate before implementation:
inspect the narrowest relevant locked source/assets, record `reference/notes/features/<feature>.md`,
then define semantic invariants, safe deviations, optimization opportunities and acceptance
criteria. Preserve recognizable behavior; exact reproduction is one option rather than the
default requirement. Do not ship an arbitrary placeholder when a researched presentation or an
intentional documented alternative is practical.

## Canonical commands

Use `just` recipes instead of repeatedly inventing command sequences.

Typical loop:

```text
just doctor
just refs-status        # when reference material may matter
just bootstrap-check

implement a coherent batch

just ci
just smoke
just sample-game       # dependency-direction integration check
```

Before extending an existing mixed M0-M3 subsystem, consult `ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md`. Put reusable
mechanism in engine/Game API crates and game rules in `minecraft-b173`; migrate only the slice
needed for the change.

For a substantial optimization, document the expected performance/frame-time, memory,
scalability and extensibility benefits against visual cost, semantic cost, implementation
complexity and maintenance cost. Use measurements where possible and qualitative reasoning where
measurement is not yet available; do not invent numerical scores.

Fetch public research inputs with `just refs-fetch` when needed. Do not make normal builds depend on
network access or on reference repositories being present.

## Defect batching

Fix immediately: build blockers, crashes in the required scenario, security/memory-safety issues,
data corruption, broken contracts and architecture mistakes that become expensive if left.

Record lower-priority functional/polish/cleanup issues in `docs/DEFECTS.md` and repair related
issues together later.

## Documentation discipline

Update architecture/decision documents when the implementation changes a durable contract. Do not
rewrite documentation as a substitute for code.

## Research

For current Rust/library behavior, prefer official docs. If Context7 is available, use it. For
codebase-wide symbol work, prefer Serena when available. Use local tools (`rg`, `git`, `jq`,
`cargo metadata`, `cargo tree`, source reading) as a reliable fallback.

For Beta behavior, protocol, legacy formats or visual conventions, read `reference/SOURCES.md`, run
`just refs-status` and select the narrowest source that answers the question. Cross-check
nontrivial ambiguities rather than inheriting one reference implementation blindly. Durable
project conclusions belong in `reference/notes/`, not as pasted source excerpts.

`just refs-lock` may be used after significant research to record the exact third-party reference
commits consulted.

For block/item presentation regressions, start with `just render-test face-DIRECTION --mode
corners`, then `--mode uv`, before changing atlas mappings. Check both positional and UV
triangle orientation. Use `just render-test-all` for world/dropped/GUI comparisons, including
rear views and native GUI scale; inspect the images, not only the command exit status.
`just fidelity-m3` now runs these deterministic offscreen captures and exits. Keep PNGs under
ignored `target/render-tests/`; do not commit local proprietary-texture captures. CPU tests
remain GPU/asset independent. Captures do not replace manual acceptance when a milestone requires
interactive review; M3's required review is complete.
